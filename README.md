# Overview
During this analysis the mean focus is known the different cases regarding ilegal constructions during January to December. Furthermore, each analysis will be considering recent and old constructions.
# Libraries

| Libraries     | Importance                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------|
| Pandas        | Analyze and manipulate database|
| Matplotlib    | Create graphs                  |
| Numpy         | Multidimensional array object  |

The present libraries were applied to build the present analysis. In the case of pandas was used for read the database, in the case of Matplotlib is for make graphs to visualize each analysis. Numpy was applied to reach some
stadistical analysis.

# Pie chart transferred to judicial process for each month

In this graph the column that is considered is "Demolición y Reconstruccción Numero Total de traslados a tribunales este año hasta finales de este mes", then the column was group by month. The values that were "Nan"
criteria were filled by 0. Furthermore, the total count is for applying the sum of the accounts and being able to visualize them in one pie chart which contains the proportion of each number of cases. The number of
instances located twice represents more than half which means that for further analysis getting more importance and could reach  a deep analysis.

# Histogram for recent ilegal construction at the end to the previous month and the relation to ilegal acumulate constructions from january to december regarding renovations during one specific month

The histogram shows that the majority of cases fall within the lower range(0-100), with a significant drop-off in frequency as the values increase. There are also a few notable peaks at higher values , but these are much less frequent.
The scatter plot indicates a possitive trend, where the number of cases or the measured quantity increases with the index or time. This suggests that there is some form of growth or increase  over the period or sequence.
The concentration of cases indicated in histogram that most ilegal new construction cases are concentrated at the lower end of the spectrum, with fewer cases as the values increases. This suggests that smaller-scale or less severe
cases are more common. The scatter plot shows a general increase in the vaariable over time or across the index, which could indicate a rising trend in the number of cases or another related measure.

# Boxplot of Z-Scores for Columns
  The left boxplot shows a more concentrated distribution with two outliers indicating occasional high values for the number of license renewals this month. The right boxplot indicates a wider spread of data with no outliers for
  the number of demolitions this month. The central tendencies for both variables are relatively close to the mean, with slight differences. As a conclussion, the number of license renewals this month shows lower variability compared 
  to the number of demolitions this moth. Furthermore, the presence of ouliers in the licence renewals data suggests occasional spikes, whereas the demolitions data is more uniformly distributed. Both  variables have medians close
  to their respectly means, indicating symmetric distributions around the mean.

# Bar chart considering the number of existence  demolish ilegal constructions during each month   
In the present bar chart the number of ilegal constructions considering the demolish during each month shows a highest value november around 350 and as the lowest one September close to 50 which mean that is neccesary review
for further analysis why during this month represent a highest number of demolish.
# Tendency between respect new ilegal constructions identified each month vs the demolish construction during each month
The number of illegal new constructions identified during each month shows the highest tendency instead of the demolished. Nevertheless, during February the number of license renovations reached the number of demotions around 50. Furthermore, the highest number of licenses identified was in September
